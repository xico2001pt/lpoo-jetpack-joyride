In this game, the Player's primary goal is to travel as far as possible, while collecting coins to buy useful power-ups, and avoiding hazards such as Energy Walls and Laser Beams. The Menus are navigable with the `Keyboard Arrows` and `Enter Key`, while the Player is controlled with the `Left Mouse Button`.
